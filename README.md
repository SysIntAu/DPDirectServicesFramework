# Welcome to the DPDirect Services Framework

## Summary
The DPDirect Services Framework is an XML driven DataPower Web Services framework.
DataPower GUI familiartiy or domain knowledge is not essential. Service development is pure XML, requiring only an XML editor to develop:
- WSDL and XSD interfaces
- XML service configuration
- XSL stylesheet XML transformation

## Overview
The DPDirect Services Framework provides a robust and consistant service chain, enabling any number of optional processing steps in any order, including AAA, schema validation, XML-to-any transformation, MTOM encoding and decoding, and service calls. The framework supports multiple transport protocols and data formats.
